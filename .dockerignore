# .dockerignore works like .gitignore but for Docker builds
# Prevents these files from being copied into the container image
# Result: Smaller images, faster builds, no accidental secret leaks

# Python cache (will be regenerated inside container)
__pycache__/

# Documentation (not needed at runtime)
